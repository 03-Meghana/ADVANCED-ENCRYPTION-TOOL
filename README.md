## DESCRIPTION OF TASK :

TASK NAME - Advanced Encryption Tool

GOAL - The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a secure, efficient, and easy-to-use file encryption and decryption utility. In an increasingly digital world, data confidentiality has become a fundamental requirement. This tool aims to provide users—regardless of their technical background—with a reliable means to protect sensitive files using robust cryptographic algorithms and a simplified graphical interface.

OBJECTIVES - This project is centered around the following objectives:
           - Implement AES-256 encryption, one of the most widely used and secure symmetric encryption standards available.
           - Allow users to encrypt and decrypt files via a password-based key derivation mechanism to eliminate the need for manual key exchange.
           - Provide a clean, interactive GUI that enables quick access to the encryption or decryption workflow.
           - Include security practices such as salt generation and safe password storage to resist brute-force and dictionary attacks.
           - Make the tool lightweight, portable, and easy to deploy across machines using executables.
    The final result is a secure application that protects file content with cryptographic integrity while remaining approachable to users through an intuitive interface.

PLATFORMS USED - 
           - Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The primary development environment where the tool was coded, tested, and debugged.
           - GitHub: Used for version control and code hosting, enabling collaboration, backups, and issue tracking.
           - Windows OS: The application and its GUI were optimized and tested for Windows environments. However, the core logic is OS-independent and can be adapted for                              cross-platform use.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES - 
           - Python: Core programming language for both the encryption backend and GUI.
           - cryptography Library: Utilized for its high-level abstraction of AES encryption and Fernet key management.
           - PBKDF2HMAC: A password-based key derivation function used to generate secure encryption keys with added salt.
           - base64 & os modules: For secure encoding and random salt generation.
           - Tkinter: Python’s standard GUI library to create a lightweight and simple graphical user interface.
          
KEY FEATURES - 
           - AES-256 File Encryption/Decryption: Securely converts files into unreadable formats and reverses the process with a valid password.
           - Salted Key Derivation: Ensures that every encryption cycle is unique, even if the same password is reused.
           - Simple Drag-and-Drop Interface: Users can easily select files and interact via clearly labeled buttons.
           - Error Handling: Notifies users about incorrect passwords, tampered files, or unsupported formats.
           - File Name Tagging: Encrypted files get a .enc suffix and decrypted files get .dec, making it easy to identify file status.

APPLICATIONS - This tool has a wide array of real-world applications:
             - Secure Personal Storage: Users can encrypt private photos, documents, or financial records.
             - Data Transmission: Safely encrypt files before emailing or uploading them to the cloud.
             - Educational Demonstration: A practical example of how cryptographic principles like AES-256 and key derivation are used in real systems.
             - Regulatory Compliance: Assists small businesses in meeting data protection requirements by offering file-level encryption.
